<h1>Group Roster Project</h1>

<h3>Group Roster is a project designed, and implemented by a group from codecademy's full-stack career path learners.</h3>
<h4>We have a very diverse group and most of use are in different time zones but we make it work.</h4>
<p>Some tools that we have utilized include: Jira, Figma, Figma frames for design mockups, and we have been communicating daily on discord</p>
<p>This project was designed for our group so we can plan, and assign different components of various projects to one another.</p>
<p>We will be adding every new Full-Stack Group member to the website no matter how far down the road they join.</p>
<p>Everyone that wants to be included will be included in every project, no matter the progress they have made on the path. Everyone is welcome!</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone who currently is, and will in the future, be a part of this amazing group of individuals!</p>
