# Group Roster Project

Group Roster is a project designed, and implemented by
a group from codecademy's full-stack career path learners.
We have a very diverse group and most of us are in different
time zones but we make it work.
Some tools that we have utilized include: Jira, Figma,
Figma frames for design mockups, and we have been communicating daily on discord
This project was designed for our group so we can plan,
and assign different components of various projects to one another.
We will be adding every new Full-Stack Group member to the
website no matter how far down the road they join.
Everyone that wants to be included will be included in every project,
no matter the progress they have made on the path. Everyone is welcome!
Thank you to everyone who currently is, and will in the future,
be a part of this amazing group of individuals!
